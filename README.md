# webgl-test

A simple experiment in 3D rendering with WebGL

## Running

This project has no runtime dependencies, but it is setup to build with `gulp` and `webpack`.

`npm install` dev dependencies, then run `gulp watch` to run a webserver which rebuilds on file changes.

It's really some cubes and teapots :D
